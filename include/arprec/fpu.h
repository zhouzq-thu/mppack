 * Contains functions necessary to set and restore the round-to-double
 * flat in the FPU.  Some processors, notably the Intel x86 processors
 * (and their clones) have floating point register wider than double, 
 * that can cause problems with some of the algorithms in the arprec 
 * package.
 *
 * Currently only x86 processors (under windows or linux) are supported, 
 * but similar fix may be needed for other processors with wider-than-double 
 * registers, e.g., Motorola 680x0 series and Intel itanium series.
